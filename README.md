# Inspiration:
We were inspired by many other popular LMS's out there, such as Schoology LMS and Canvas LMS. However, these LMS's are often set out to solve a specific problem. That's why we created Ventura LMS, a Learning Management System that combines the positives of all popular LMN's out there into one great solution.

# What it does:
Ventura LMS solves a number of problems in the education field, and also simply improves a lot of things. Ventura LMS enables easy communication between User and Teacher, with the inbuilt thread based Ventura Communication section. Ventura LMS also allows teachers to easily create classes and assignments, usually within seconds! (Compared the the tedious process of creating classes in other LMS's). Finally, one of the groundbreaking features of Ventura LMS is the (Beta) Ventura Analytical AI! This AI analyzes each and every assignment the user submits, and performs heavy operations in order to calculate a grade trendline, and a predicted trendline. Based on this output, the AI contacts parents via the Parent Inbox with information on the child's progress. (This is still a beta feature!)

# How we built it:
We thought a lot about the technology stack to use to build Ventura LMS. Eventually, we settled on a powerful React + Typescript + Tailwind Stack for the frontend, and the robust ExpressJS + MySQL+ Prisma stack for the backend. We took into consideration the difficulty of each stack, as well as each stacks capabilities, and this was the list we ended up with.

# Challenges we ran into:
We ran into quite a few challenges in the making of Ventura LMS. One challenge was definitely deployment of the backend. Due to our selection of the render.com free tier service, our API was significantly slowed down due to the limited CPU and RAM offered. However, we quickly refactored our code further and helped speed up the system.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are definitely proud of the UI and User Experience that our web application is able to provide to users. Even though we faced challenges along the way, we were able to persevere and submit a working application!

# What we learned:
We learned the ins-and-outs of working in the TS+REACT+TAILWIND stack, as well as how to properly program and maintain a backend of extremely high complexity.

# What's next for Ventura LMS:
What's next? Well, in the future we definitely see a huge improvement in VenturaAI's capabilities. Now, it requires a lot of data so it doesn't start inputting feedback until the user has submitted some 20+ assignment. One obvious thing to do it to limit that number. We also had to leave some features unfinished due to time constraints (such as settings page), so updating those is whats next as well.
